    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a very spicy verseion of Nashville Fried Chicken from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/q48qt4/nashville_hot_fried_chicken_recipe_in_the_comments/">reddit post</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>8 Chicken thighs or breast (skin on)</li><li>Oil for Frying</li></ul>
    <p><strong>For the brine:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Quarts Water</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Frank's Red Hot</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the breading:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups of Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Salt</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Cayenne Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the Hot Oil Coating:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of Caynne Powder</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Ghost Pepper Powder</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Hot Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First mix up the brine and brine your chicken parts for 1 hour. Once it is done, drain the brine.</li>
        <li>Stir the flour mixture together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix together the dry ingredients for the hot oil coating. Either heat up some oil or use some of the hot oil after you fry the chicken. Bloom the spices in the hot oil in a small sauce pan or bowl. Stir to keep it from burning and set aside.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, shake off the excess, and allow to rest on a rack. Keep the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat up the frying oil to 350 F. I just use a Dutch oven. Once the oil is heated, dredge the chicken a second time and place in the fryer. The temperature will drop, try to keep it around 325 F. Don't crowd it too much and use multiple batches if you need to. Once it is done, allow to drain on a cooling rack set over a sheet pan. This took me about 16 minutes. You can keep it warm in a 200 F oven while the rest cooks.</li>
        <li>Before serving, brush both sides with the hot oil mixture and enjoy. Adjust the spices to your taste. This is hot, but still enjoyable for me.</li>
    </ol>
