        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Been working on this recipe since I got addicted to Walkerwoods paste. Started reading more about it and seemed to find a recipe that worked with few ingredients and a little prep work. Been tweaking and feeding to friends who want more. Took a bunch of pics one day to help a friend who didnt understand some of the steps. Used that to help make a visual recipe for y'alls. Including the text recipe here too:</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oz Whole Allspice/Pimeto</li>
            <li>1 oz Sichuan Peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 oz Black Peppercorns</li>
            <li>4-6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>10-12 scotch bonnet peppers, can use other super hots like habeneros in equal weight/size</li>
            <li>2 oranges</li>
