        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Been working on this recipe since I got addicted to Walkerwoods paste. Started reading more about it and seemed to find a recipe that worked with few ingredients and a little prep work. Been tweaking and feeding to friends who want more. Took a bunch of pics one day to help a friend who didnt understand some of the steps. Used that to help make a visual recipe for y'alls. Including the text recipe here too:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oz Whole Allspice/Pimeto</li>
            <li>1 oz Sichuan Peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 oz Black Peppercorns</li>
            <li>4-6 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>10-12 Scotch Bonnet Peppers (can use other super hots like habeneros in equal weight/size)</li>
            <li>2 Oranges</li>
            <li>8-10 Chicken Thighs (preferably boneless and skinless)</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prep the Paste:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a large bowl and set aside for adding ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add Allspice, Szechwan and Black peppercorns to a large pan.</li> <li>They should not be crowded so you can shake them around.</li> <li>Roast them in the pan until they; start to smoke, darken in color, and some of the peppers pop from the heat.</li> 
                <li>Turn the heat off at this point and ready a mortar and pestle.</li> 
                <li>Add the set of spices in batches so not to over crowd.</li> <li>They should be changed about three times.</li> 
                <li>Pound the mix into powder and add each batch to the large bowl.</li>
                <li>Roast garlic cloves and peppers in the oven or grill.</li> <li>Turn peppers over as they develop dark spots.</li> 
                <li>Take out after 10-15 minutes when they are a dark color for much of the outside.</li> 
                <li>Add roasted garlic cloves, peppers, and a pinch of kosher salt to a molcajete, larger mortar and pestle, or food processor.</li> <li>Pound and mash, or like, hit a button, to make the combination into a paste.</li> 
                <li>Scrape the sides at intervals to combine well.</li> 
                <li>Add the paste to the large bowl.</li>
                <li>Zest two oranges over the spice and paste mixture.</li> 
                <li>Juice one orange into the mixture.</li> 
                <li>Mix paste mixture well.</li> 
                <li>See how thick the paste is a this point.</li> 
                <li>To be thinner and less pasty add the juice of half the other orange.</li> 
                <li>Mix and adjust as needed.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Apply to Chicken:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Glove up. Y'all hands getting all up in the chicken and paste. Your hands will thank you.</li>
                <li>Prepare your chicken line, your chicken to be jerked, spice paste, and container to hold the chicken.</li> 
                <li>Apply a thin later to the chicken all over and place it in the container.</li> 
                <li>Fold thighs in on them selves so they fit better in their container.</li> 
                <li>Marinade chicken at least 30 mins in the refrigerator.</li> 
                <li>Use tongs to apply to heat. Grill for best results.</li> 
                <li>Oven and broil and other methods are also acceptable.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
